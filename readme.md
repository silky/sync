Sync is util which will help you to keep your forks up to date!

all you need is: /etc/conf.d/repolist.conf

``` shell
[Repos]
user:
  /home/nen/contrib/haskell/hackport -t git
  /home/nen/contrib/haskell/hackport/cabal -p /home/nen/contrib/haskell/hackport

  /home/nen/contrib/mono/FAKE -t git -b develop
sudo:
  /home/gentoo-haskell
```

(git and master branch are defaults)

and run forks-sync. [not that it can't setup repos for you yet]

it will be look alike that:

``` shell
=====================================================================================
                     sync: Global repositories synchronizer v.1.4  
=====================================================================================
